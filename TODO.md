# TODOs

## KNOWN ISSUES
* refreshing large directories takes (in ex. "/bin") takes too much time, it slows (T)UI

The order is totally random:
## VISUAL STUFF

* make better logo ^^
* provide proportional quad window (not only 50/50 division of full scr),
  in example hardcoded 70% height upper part and 30% lower part windows.
* class with @staticmethod methods to display folder content (hardcoded folder as for now)
* class to draw button (default height lets say 3 lines), draw the button somewhere 
* ability to redraw and reposition the windows
* dividing windows according to few schemes like split horizontal, split vertical,
  50/50,70/30,80/20 etc.


## Key bindings
SUGGESTION - option for user to have some 'vim' key bindings
SUGGESTION - like in vim, ability to set one key as <leader> 

* ? - shows help
* q - exit 
* c - copy
* m - move
* s - perform sed on file g - grep a - awk b - batch script



## Other przeszkadzajki

* Ability to run commands in background with updating results in small window - threads
* Marking directories for operation 
 e.g marking one directory as main two others as secondary and do rsync between main and 2
 others
* copy/move files between windows
* rename files
*  open file for edit in preffered editor of choice - nano,vim,emacs
* simple file edition inside app
* DIFFICULT! NO ONE EVER DID THIS! - rewrite emacs org-table mode in some normal language
  instead of LISP ^^
* Ability to perform sed,awk,grep operations on selected file and see result in separate
  window or redirect output to a file.
