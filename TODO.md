# TODOs
The order is totally random:
* make better logo
* provide proportional quad window (not only 50/50 division of full scr),
  in example hardcoded 70% height upper part and 30% lower part windows.
* class with @staticmethod methods to display folder content (hardcoded folder as for now)
* class to draw button (default height lets say 3 lines), draw the button somewhere
